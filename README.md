# Problem Statement 1: Content Performance Optimization
Netflix needs to understand which content types, genres, and ratings perform best across different markets to optimize their content acquisition and production strategy. Without data-driven insights, Netflix risks investing in underperforming content categories and missing opportunities in high-performing segments.
Business Impact: Improved understanding of content performance metrics can lead to more targeted content investments, higher viewer engagement, and better allocation of production resources across genres and formats.
# Problem Statement 2: Geographic Market Intelligence
Netflix requires comprehensive insights into regional content preferences and engagement patterns to tailor their global expansion strategy. Without region-specific analytics, Netflix may miss opportunities to customize their content library for specific markets.
Business Impact: Identifying regional content preferences enables Netflix to develop market-specific acquisition strategies, targeted marketing campaigns, and localized content recommendations, ultimately driving subscriber growth and retention in key markets.
